Would be nice to have it generate a Games Launcher a ssWPI code bundle and a folder or 7z to extract straight to the sources\ssWPI folder. Would also be nice to have it grab the latest 7z.exe and .DLL off the running system, so it gets updated on a build too (probably can't as I include the x86 one as well)
