## Introduction:

 
Figure 1

ssWPI v9 is a tool made by OS modders for OS modders, but is also simple enough for end users to use.  Its main function is to install a selection of applications and games silently.  ssWPI can categorize each item, display a screenshot and list a description making it easier to find the applications you want.  With the detailed information, you can see which applications and games you have available without needing to spend time looking over readme files or searching on the internet.

Optionally ssWPI can be used as a game launcher for any of your ppGames, while still retaining control so that you can quit a game at will, select a new game, and keep playing.  This is an especially convenient mode for children’s games, allowing them to easily switch to a new game.

The installation of applications from ssWPI is usually automated, and using SetupS technologies, ssWPI is able to sort your start menu, clean your desktop, tweak your settings and register your products.  With the ability to detect which OS you run it on, it will hide the applications that would not work if you tried to install them, including x86 and x64 detection.  It also checks to see which applications are already installed and hides them from the list of items you can install.  All these features are there to keep order on your PC, save you time, and make things easier to get your computer running the way you want, with the tools you need.

ssWPI can be used as either a Pre-Installer or a Post-Installer.  As a Pre-Installer, ssWPI can be run at the start of Windows XP/Vista /7 installs, allowing you to preselect the applications you want installed on the fresh OS before you actually begin the OS installation process.  By the time you get back from eating dinner your OS will be sitting on the desktop ready to go with all your choices installed and configured.  As a Post-Installer, it can be run from the DVD/USB anytime you need to install an application or game.

## Using ssWPI:

ssWPI handles three basic types of applications, or items.  They are:

* ssApps - Applications that install silently. i.e. no user interaction.
* ppApps - permanent portable Applications.  Applications that are self contained.
* ppGames - permanent portable Games.  Games that are self contained.

ssApps are pretty much what most people think of when they think of computer software applications.  They are installed on your HDD along with all the bells and whistles.  They tend to keep all their settings and preferences either in the system registry or some other system file so that once installed, they run only on that one machine until they are uninstalled and reinstalled on another machine.  The only difference in that and an ssApp, is that ssApps are designed to install silently.  Permanent portable Apps (ppApps), being portable, do not generally use the registry or system file locations, but rather keep all their personalization information in a file stored with the application itself.  This makes the application self contained and easy to move from one computer or OS to another.  They are best installed to a non-system partition/HDD allowing you to use them again even after a fresh OS installation.  Using SetupS technologies, ssWPI is able to create shortcuts and associate file types automatically even for these portable applications.  They are also designed to install silently.  Permanent portable Games (ppGames ) are games that are self contained in the same way as ppApps.  They do not require any other materials, such as a CD/DVD to be present in order to play the game.

ssWPI has default locations it searches for the various types of apps.  They are:

* ssApps - X:\ssAppsInstalls 
* ppApps - X:\ppAppsInstalls
* ppGames - X:\ppGamesInstalls

Where X: is any valid drive on your system.  ssWPI will search every drive on your system looking for those folders and any app they might contain.  As you become more familiar with ssWPI, you will learn how to specify other locations that you wish ssWPI to search for apps.

ssWPI requires that you have an identification file stored with each of your items, either applications or games, in order for them to be detected and added to the list of possible installable items.  That file’s name is dependent on the type of item.  Those file names are:

* ssApps - ssApp.app
* ppApps - ppApp.app
* ppGames - ppGame.ppg

A companion program of ssWPI, SetupS, works alongside ssWPI to do the actual installation of the apps using the information in these files.  These .app and .ppg files are created by the SetupS Builder or can be written in notepad or any text editor if you are comfortable doing so.  They contain summary information for each app including Title, Version, Description, and Install Path, among other information. You are also able to include an optional screenshot for ssWPI to display and an icon for use during installation. Through SetupS, for an individual app installation, you’re also able to go into the ssAppsInstalls/ppAppsInstalls/ppGamesInstalls folders and by double clicking, run the .app or .ppg file to install and integrate the app automatically.  Another method for installing the app is to use the Send To menu in the Windows Context Menu by right clicking on the app and selecting “Send To – SetupS”.  No matter which of the methods you choose, ssWPI, double clicking, or Send To, SetupS uses the information in the .app or .ppg files to install the apps of your choosing, extracting them if necessary from a compressed format, creates their shortcuts, associates file types and anything else you may need to do to keep your important applications set up and ready to go.  Regenerator is another included tool made to create the shortcuts and associate the file types for all your installed ppApps.  If you had previously installed them to a non-system partition/HDD, then by simply running this on a fresh OS you can have them all reintegrated into your new OS without needing to reinstall or extract them from a DVD/USB device.  This reduces install time and allows you to keep things as you like it.

It is important to remember that in order for all the available features of ssWPI to function correctly, such as being able to hide items under certain conditions or group them together with similar items, the ssApp.app/ppApp.app/ppGame.ppg file needs to contain the correct settings.  More information on the features of SetupS and Regenerator, along with details on making your applications and games function with ssWPI, is available in the SetupS Builder's Help file and Manual.

The general usage of ssWPI is mouse driven, although you are also able to use the keyboard to navigate and select your items and options.  You are able to type the name of an app at any time to quickly jump to it, if it is somewhere in the currently displayed list of items.  The purpose of ssWPI's main screen is to find, review, and select/deselect the items you wish to install on your OS.  This involves switching between categories, clicking on the items of interest, seeing the screenshot and description and choosing to select it for installation.  Once you are happy with the selection of applications, simply click the Start button.  If you are preselecting items before an OS install using the Command Line “ssWPI.exe –NewSetup”, it will store the selection in a file on your computer.  Running “ssWPI.exe -Install” any time after this initial selection will install those preselected apps for you without any interaction.  If you’re using ssWPI after the OS installation, when you press the Start button it will open up a Mini Installer window showing the progress of the installation of your selections, as shown in Figure 3.



### Loading Screen -
The loading screen, also known as a splash screen, shown in Figure 2, is included as an indication that your OS is busy looking for applications/games.  If you are using the auto start Command Line “ssWPI.exe -AutoStartTimer=18", then you will also see a countdown timer, shown in Figure 7.  Once the timer reaches 0, ssWPI will load in a Default Preset (selection of items), if those items are present on your system, and exit.  That selection of items can be installed later using the Command Line “ssWPI.exe -Install”.

Right click the Items list for a menu that allows you to change Item selection and/or load/save a Preset.  Other options are available by clicking the Setup button.



The Hidden Items count includes Items that are not intended for the currently running Operating System.  ssWPI cannot detect all previously installed applications and therefore may not hide these applications from the Items list.

 
Figure 6
## Category - 
This lists the Categories that are found inside the ssApp.app, ppApp.app and ppGame.ppg files.  Clicking them will only show items in that category.  The “All” category lists all available items depending on your options and current OS/Arch.  “Favorites” is a category available in the Game Launcher.  By right clicking a game you can toggle making it a favorite, which are shown in a different color than non favorites.  

## Items - 
A list of available Items (applications or games) you can install, or play if you are in Game Launcher mode.  Clicking the name will show you the screenshot and description.  Clicking the Checkbox will select it for installation.  You are also able to use the arrow keys to navigate, and Space or Enter to select.

## Title - 
This displays the title of the currently selected application.  It is displayed at the top right of the screen.  Clicking this will open the item’s URL in your browser if specified.

## Screenshot - 
This is displayed in the right panel.  It is a graphic file of jpg format that is optionally included in each apps subfolder, alongside the ssApp.app/ppApp.app/ppGame.ppg.  There can also be another graphic file of png format that will display during installation of the app in the Mini Installer.

## Description - 
Category: Example
Location: X:\ssAppsInstalls\SampleApp\ssApp.app (where x: is the drive of the installing application)
Install To: Destination Location.

The above is shown in the description box, followed by a description of the item as specified in the ssApp.app/ppApp.app/ppGame.ppg file.  This describes the application or game that is to be installed.

Examples of Command Line options:
Example 1:
If the value stored in ssWPI_Options.ini file is:  AutoStartTimer=18, then:
When ssWPI is run it will start a countdown, as determined by the value of AutoStartTimer stored in the ssWPI_Options.ini file, then load in a Default Preset, compare that list with the files available on your system, store the list of valid files back out to “ssWPI.ini”, and exit ssWPI.  (Install with ssWPI.exe -Install)

In this case ssWPI will begin the process described above after 18 seconds as shown in Figure 7.
 
 
Figure 7
Example 2:
ssWPI  -AutoStartTimer=25

In this case ssWPI will begin the Auto Start process after 25 seconds since the command line argument will override what is set in ssWPI_Options.ini.

Example 3:

Before OS installation:
This should be placed in a startup sequence that is executed prior to installing an OS:

ssWPI -NewSetup

This will allow the selection of applications prior to the OS being installed but not install them until after the OS is installed when ssWPI -Install triggers the start.


After OS installation:
This should be placed in the scripts that are executed after the OS has finished installing:

ssWPI -Install

This will then install the preselected applications that were chosen prior to installation.
Quitting ssWPI:

If, while you are using ssWPI, you decide you need to just stop what you are doing and quit ssWPI, simply close the Main screen.  If you prefer, the ESC key will also cause ssWPI to close.
